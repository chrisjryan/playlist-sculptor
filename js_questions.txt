js questions


in the header of an HTML page, does each line <script> line actually run each script? or does it "import" the functions in the script analogously to python? can it do either?

how do you know where javasccript functions come from? (i.e., when you see them in the script but did not write the functiom yourself.)

in the getJSON function, does the `data' in the 3rd argument come from the JSON request?

does the whole <span> in the example get overwritten by the jquery call? wouldn't this overwrite too much?

why should the <button> be disabled?
